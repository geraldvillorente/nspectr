# Installing

## Binaries
Coming soon...

## Building
Go 1.6.3+ is required. Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) properly installed, including setting up your [GOPATH] (https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)

```
cd $GOPATH
go get github.com/iamstoick/nspct
```

## Make the command globally available
You should now have `nspct` binary in the bin directory: `$GOPATH/bin`. 
To make `$GOPATH/bin` globally available so you can execute the command `nspct` anywhere in the terminal/console:
* Open your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file.
* Add the `$GOPATH/bin` path at the bottom like this `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`. 
* Save and close.
* Reload `~/.bash_profile` by running `. ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal/console. Same method for `~/.bashrc` file.
